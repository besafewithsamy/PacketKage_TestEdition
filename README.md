**Network traffic analysis and investigation, built around understanding what happened.**

PacketKage turns raw network traffic into a clear picture of network activity. Instead of forcing you to work through thousands of packets to understand an incident, it reconstructs the traffic into flows, hosts, protocols, behaviors, events, and alerts  while keeping the underlying packets available as evidence.

> Here is what happened. Let me show you the network evidence behind it.

## Overview

## What PacketKage Does

### Traffic Investigation

* Live interface capture with BPF filtering and auto-stop
* Reconstructs bidirectional TCP and UDP flows
* IPv4 and IPv6 traffic with correct internal/external direction classification
* Tracks packets, bytes, duration, and direction
* Detects retransmissions, resets, and connection failures
* Provides packet-level evidence for investigations
* Delete captures (and all derived analysis data + the stored PCAP) via `DELETE /api/captures/{id}` or the Capture page - blocked with an actionable error while an analysis is still running

### Host & Protocol Analysis

* Builds profiles for observed hosts
* Identifies services, ports, and communication relationships
* Reconstructs DNS transactions (A and AAAA records)
* Analyzes HTTP requests and responses
* Extracts TLS sessions with SNI and negotiated version
* Labels QUIC (HTTP/3) traffic on UDP 443
* Extracts plaintext protocol banners (SSH, SMTP, FTP)
* Decodes DHCP conversations (DORA) with client hostnames
* Provides protocol-level behavioral statistics

### Suspicious Activity Detection

PacketKage uses deterministic and explainable rules rather than relying on black-box machine learning.

Current detections include:

* Port scanning
* C2-style beaconing
* Low-and-slow beaconing (long-interval periodic check-ins)
* DNS tunneling indicators
* DGA (algorithmically-generated domain) indicators
* NXDOMAIN bursts
* ARP spoofing (IP claimed by multiple MACs)
* Lateral movement (internal fan-out on admin ports)
* Data exfiltration (volume + first-contact correlation)
* Suspicious ports
* Excessive connection failures
* Direct-IP connections without DNS
* Unusually high outbound traffic
* Suspicious user agents

Each alert provides a score, severity, explanation, detection reasons, supporting evidence, and related flows.

Related alerts are also correlated into **incidents**  per-host groups of alerts that belong to one campaign  with a plain-English story of what happened.

### Timeline, Graph & Replay

PacketKage turns network activity into an investigation timeline that can be filtered by host, protocol, event type, severity, and time.

It also provides:

* Network relationship graphs
* Chronological event timelines
* Incident replay
* Flow and packet drill-down

### Evidence Graph 2.0


![Graph overview](assets/graph.png)

The Graph page is built on a materialized, provenance-carrying relationship graph (versioned API `/api/graph/v2`, alongside the legacy graph). Every edge carries a provenance class:

* **observed** : directly seen in packet-derived artifacts (flows, DNS, TLS, HTTP)
* **correlated** : derived by deterministic correlation (incidents → alerts)
* **enriched** : static enrichment, clearly labeled as such (MITRE technique mapping)

Nodes are stable IDs (`host:{ip}`, `domain:{name}`, `service:{ip}:{port}`, `alert:{id}`, `incident:{source_ip}`, `case:{id}`) hydrated from existing tables at query time  no data duplication. Nothing here invents evidence: if an edge has no alert evidence, its explanation is empty; if a technique has no matching rule, it is not shown.

Investigation modes:

* **Investigate**  interactive evidence graph with node and edge drill-down panels
* **Attack Path**  bounded path extraction between two entities (every hop is an observed/correlated edge; the assembled path is an inference, labeled as such)
* **Blast Radius**  reachability analysis from a host, computed only from observed relationships
* **Timeline**  chronological view of the graph events
* **Evidence Chain**  walks Conclusion → Detection → Evidence → Flows → PCAP reference for every displayed claim

Suspicious edges explain themselves by aggregating the real alerts that touch a pair  scores and explanations are deterministic, not invented. Detections are enriched with either official MITRE ATT&CK technique mappings or clearly labeled PacketKage internal classifications; internal classifications never render as ATT&CK IDs.

### Cases & Investigation Workflow

* Group related captures into a **case**  one incident, one story
* Merged chronological timeline across every capture in the case
* Case-level statistics: total packets, alerts, correlated incidents
* One-click **HTML investigation report** (printable to PDF) with alerts, reasons, evidence, incidents, and timeline highlights
* Alert triage: tag as `confirmed`, `false-positive`, or `escalated`, add analyst notes, and filter out triaged alerts
* Alert flow deep links that jump straight to the packet evidence

### Network Engineering

PacketKage is not limited to security investigations. It also provides network health information including:

* Bandwidth and packet rates
* Top talkers
* TCP health
* DNS health
* Traffic distribution
* Network issues

## Quick Start


### One command with containers (no prerequisites except the runtime)

> **Authentication is required.** PacketKage has no local accounts and refuses
> to serve protected routes (HTTP 503) until an OIDC provider is configured.
> Either complete the built-in **setup wizard** at `/setup` (no env editing), or
> configure it via `.env`. The fastest path to a bundled provider is the
> Authentik stack — full walkthrough in
> [docs/authentik-setup.md](docs/authentik-setup.md).

**Option 1 — PacketKage only (existing OIDC provider):**

```bash
docker compose up -d --build          # Docker — then open /setup and connect your provider
podman-compose up -d --build          # Podman
```

To configure declaratively instead of via the wizard, `cp .env.example .env`,
set `PACKETKAGE_OIDC_*` and `PACKETKAGE_PUBLIC_URL`, then start (env values are
authoritative and appear read-only in the wizard).

**Option 2 — PacketKage + bundled Authentik (local evaluation):**

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set AUTHENTIK_* secrets
echo '127.0.0.1 authentik' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.authentik.yml up -d --build
```

Then create the provider, groups, and client credentials as described in
[docs/authentik-setup.md](docs/authentik-setup.md), and open
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The compose configuration binds PacketKage to `127.0.0.1` by default, so it is
reachable only from the machine running the container. To serve other machines,
terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (sample: `reverse-proxy/nginx.conf`) and set
`PACKETKAGE_PUBLIC_URL` to the public `https://` URL.

Shutdown:

```bash
docker compose down     # Docker
podman-compose down     # Podman
```

### Requirements (manual setup)

* Python 3.12+
* Node.js 24.x
* npm

### Backend

Authentication is mandatory, so export the OIDC settings before starting the
API (see [docs/authentik-setup.md](docs/authentik-setup.md)):

```bash

cd PacketKage/backend

source .venv/bin/activate

export PACKETKAGE_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:5173
export PACKETKAGE_OIDC_ISSUER=https://authentik.example.com/application/o/packetkage/
export PACKETKAGE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=...
export PACKETKAGE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export PACKETKAGE_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

```

Protecting the dev server with real Authentik is awkward on a laptop; for
day-to-day development, a different OIDC provider can be used as long as it
speaks Authorization-Code + PKCE and can point its redirect URI at
`http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback`.

> **Linux - enable live capture (one-time):** live sniffing needs `CAP_NET_RAW`/`CAP_NET_ADMIN`. Grant them to the venv interpreter instead of running the backend as root:
>
> ```bash
> sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip "$(readlink -f .venv/bin/python)"
> ```
>
> Re-run it after recreating the venv. Everything except live capture works without it.

The API will be available at:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Interactive API documentation:

[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Frontend

Open another terminal:

```bash

cd PacketKage/frontend

npm run dev
```

Then open:

[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Authentication (OIDC / Authentik)

PacketKage delegates all authentication to an OpenID Connect provider
(Authentik by reference deployment). There are no local accounts and no
password storage. The flow is standard **Authorization Code + PKCE**:

1. The browser hits `/api/auth/login`, which redirects to the provider with a
   `state`, `nonce`, and PKCE `code_challenge` (kept in a short-lived,
   HttpOnly cookie).
2. The provider authenticates the user and redirects back to
   `/api/auth/callback`.
3. The backend exchanges the code, validates the ID token (signature via JWKS,
   issuer, audience, nonce, expiry) and mints its own **server-side session
   cookie** (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` over HTTPS).
4. Roles are derived **solely** from the token's group claim.

| Authentik group      | Role    | Capabilities                                      |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `packetkage-admin`   | Admin   | Everything, including deleting captures and cases |
| `packetkage-analyst` | Analyst | Upload, analyze, investigate (no destructive ops) |

Users in neither group are refused at login. Group names are configurable via
`PACKETKAGE_ADMIN_GROUP` / `PACKETKAGE_ANALYST_GROUP`.

Configuration (`PACKETKAGE_OIDC_*`, see `.env.example`):

| Variable                         | Purpose                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PACKETKAGE_OIDC_ISSUER`         | Provider base URL; **required** or the API fails closed (503) |
| `PACKETKAGE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`      | OAuth client id                                                |
| `PACKETKAGE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`  | OAuth client secret                                            |
| `PACKETKAGE_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`   | Registered callback (default `…/api/auth/callback`)           |
| `PACKETKAGE_PUBLIC_URL`          | Browser-facing base URL for post-login redirects               |
| `PACKETKAGE_SESSION_TTL`         | Session lifetime in seconds (default 8h)                       |

A step-by-step Authentik walkthrough — groups, provider, application, TLS
reverse proxy, and troubleshooting — is in
[docs/authentik-setup.md](docs/authentik-setup.md).

### First-run setup wizard

You do not have to hand-edit environment variables. While OIDC is unconfigured
the API fails closed (503) and the UI automatically opens a **setup wizard** at
[`/setup`](http://localhost:8000/setup). Enter the issuer URL, client ID/secret,
public URL, and group names, click **Test connection** (it fetches the discovery
document and signing keys), then **Save & enable**. The settings are written to
the data volume (`/data/setup.json`, `0600`) and applied immediately — no
restart, and they survive container recreation.

* **Precedence:** environment variables always win. Any value set in the
  environment appears **read-only** in the wizard.
* **Remote access:** a wizard request from a non-loopback address needs the
  one-time **bootstrap token**, printed in the backend startup logs and written
  to `/data/setup-token`. Requests from `localhost` do not.
* **Reconfiguration:** once configured, `/setup` requires an **admin** session
  (analysts receive `403`).

The wizard calls only `GET /api/setup/status` (public), and
`GET /api/setup/config`, `POST /api/setup/test`, `POST /api/setup/oidc`
(token- or admin-guarded); the client secret is never returned by the API.

### Automated dev bootstrap (one command)

For local development against the bundled Authentik, a helper script does the
same thing without any typing — it writes `.env` secrets, starts the Authentik
containers, creates the groups/provider/application via the Authentik API, and
writes `backend/data/setup.json`:

```bash
python3 scripts/packetkage-setup.py            # full auto
python3 scripts/packetkage-setup.py --dry-run  # show what it would do
python3 scripts/packetkage-setup.py --manual   # paste a UI-created client id/secret
python3 scripts/packetkage-setup.py --no-start # configure only, Authentik already up
```

It uses only the Python standard library, never starts the `packetkage`
container (so it will not collide with a native `uvicorn` on `:8000`), and is
safe to re-run. Override the browser URL with `--public-url http://localhost:8000`.

## Test Data

PacketKage includes a deterministic PCAP generator for development and testing.

From the `backend` directory with the virtual environment activated:

```bash
python ../scripts/generate_test_pcaps.py --out ../test-data/synthetic
```

The generator includes scenarios such as:

* Normal traffic
* Port scanning
* DNS tunneling
* C2-style beaconing
* Low-and-slow beaconing
* TCP connection problems
* ARP spoofing
* Lateral movement
* Data exfiltration
* DGA domains
* IPv6 traffic
* QUIC traffic
* Protocol banners (SSH/SMTP/FTP)
* DHCP lease

## Architecture

PacketKage separates packet parsing from the analysis engine through a normalized internal model.

```text

          │

     Investigation
```

Parser-specific objects do not leave the parser layer. This keeps the analysis engine independent from the underlying packet parser and makes it possible to add additional parsers in the future.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

* Python
* FastAPI
* SQLAlchemy
* SQLite
* Scapy
* Pydantic
* Authentik / OIDC (Authorization Code + PKCE, JWKS validation)
* httpx, cryptography (token exchange + ID-token signature checks)

### Frontend

* React
* TypeScript
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* Zustand
* TanStack Table
* Cytoscape.js
* Recharts

## Testing

The project is covered by three test layers — backend pytest, frontend vitest, and end-to-end Playwright (the first two run in GitHub Actions CI, E2E runs locally):

**Backend** — integration tests (pytest) over the full analysis pipeline and the
authentication stack (the suite runs a fake OIDC provider and exercises the
real Authorization-Code + PKCE flow, ID-token validation failures, and
admin/analyst authorization):

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -q
```

**Frontend unit tests** (vitest), including the auth context and route guards:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

**End-to-end** (Playwright) - boots a fake IdP, the backend, and the Vite dev
server, then drives the real UI (logging in through the provider first):

* **Smoke**: upload → analyze → alerts - the whole product in one path
* **Graph**: edge-type filter toggles, scale tiers, and the evidence graph v2 (provenance, attack path, blast radius, evidence chain)
* **Export**: CSV export of flows, and the empty-filter toast case
* **Delete**: upload → delete via confirmation modal → gone from list, including after analysis
* **Auth**: sign-in/sign-out, session persistence, and admin-only navigation
* **Analyst**: role boundary — no Admin nav, no delete affordances, Access denied on `/admin`

Self-contained:

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test
```

PacketKage also uses deterministic synthetic PCAPs to make analysis scenarios reproducible during development and testing.

## Live Capture

PacketKage can also record traffic directly from a network interface  no upload needed. On the **Capture** page:

1. Pick a network interface (and optionally a BPF filter, e.g. `tcp port 80`)
2. Press **Start live capture**  a live packet counter and auto-stop countdown appear
3. Press **Stop & analyze** (or let the auto-stop timer fire)

The recorded traffic is saved as a PCAP and flows through the exact same analysis pipeline as an upload  flows, hosts, alerts, timeline, everything.

> Note: live sniffing needs elevated permissions — the container grants them via `cap_add` (`NET_RAW`/`NET_ADMIN` in `docker-compose.yml`), and the image ships file capabilities on the interpreter so the backend runs as a non-root user. For native (non-Docker) setups, grant the venv interpreter the capabilities instead of running as root (see the Backend section above). Interface listing and all other features work unprivileged.

**Docker / Podman specifics:**

* A container only captures traffic that crosses **its own network namespace**. The loopback interface (`lo`) records traffic generated inside the container; to capture *host* traffic, run the backend natively (host networking is limited under rootless container runtimes and changes the port-binding posture).
* No `privileged: true` and no root process: the compose file adds exactly the two required capabilities, and the image runs as uid 1000 (`packetkage`).
* **Upgrading an existing deployment:** volumes created by older (root-run) images have root-owned files. Either start with a fresh volume, or once: `docker run --rm -v packetkage-data:/data alpine chown -R 1000:1000 /data` (same idea with `podman`).

## Roadmap

* Real-time streaming analysis of live captures
* PCAP analysis caching
* Additional protocol parsers

## Current Status

PacketKage is currently a local, single-user application focused on PCAP-based network investigation and analysis.

The core analysis pipeline, flow reconstruction, protocol analysis, behavioral detection, timeline, graph, replay, and network engineering features are implemented.

## Contributing

PacketKage is an evolving project. Contributions, ideas, bug reports, and improvements are welcome.
